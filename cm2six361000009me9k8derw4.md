Hope Learners, you all are now well versed with the Basics of Git & GitHub; by now you will be familiar with

* **Git Init**
    
* **Git add**
    
* **Git commit -m**
    

> If you want to refer material for Git Basic then checkout this link : [Git basics](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ahireshubham_git-activity-7254701044851478529-nJVs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

But real-world projects can get complex fast. You might need to undo changes, work with multiple branches, or combine commit histories. Knowing these commands will help you keep your code organized, streamline collaboration, and recover from mistakes.

### Git revert

Reverts a specific commit without removing it from history. It is useful if you need to ‚Äúundo‚Äù changes without erasing the commit itself, so everyone on the team can see that something was corrected.

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

This command creates a new commit that undoes changes introduced in the specified commit, leaving the rest of your history intact.

**Use Case**: Accidentally introduced a bug in an earlier commit? Use `git revert` to create a new commit that ‚Äúundoes‚Äù it.

### Git reset (soft, mixed, hard).

**What it Does**: Moves the current branch back to a specified commit, with three levels:

* **Soft**: Moves the branch pointer without changing the index or working directory.
    
* **Mixed** (default): Resets the branch pointer and index but leaves the working directory.
    
* **Hard**: Resets everything‚Äîbranch pointer, index, and working directory.
    

```bash
# Soft reset
git reset --soft <commit-hash>

# Mixed reset
git reset --mixed <commit-hash>

# Hard reset (use cautiously!)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

**Use Case**: If you want to undo recent commits while keeping changes in the working directory, use `soft`. For a clean slate, `hard` does the job ‚Äî but be careful as it permanently deletes changes.

### Git merge

**What it Does**: Combines changes from one branch into another `git merge` takes the contents of a branch and merges it with your current branch.

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

**Use Case**: When you‚Äôre ready to bring changes from a feature branch into `main`, `git merge` is the way to go.

> Note: Merging sometimes leads to *merge conflicts*, especially if two branches change the same lines of code. More on resolving these below!

### Git rebase

**What it Does**: Moves or ‚Äúreplays‚Äù changes from one branch onto another. While `merge` creates a new commit combining histories, `rebase` place each commit from your feature branch on top of the main branch.

```bash
git rebase <branch-name>
```

**Use Case**: To keep your commit history *clean and linear*, `rebase` is often the preferred method over `merge`. However, avoid rebasing shared branches, as it rewrites history and may cause conflicts for others.

### Git stash

**What it Does**: Temporarily stores changes in your working directory without committing them, making it easier to switch branches or work on something else.

```bash
git stash
# Apply stash later
git stash pop
```

**Use Case**: Ideal when you‚Äôre in the middle of work but need to pull in changes from another branch or switch to a different task. Stashing allows you to resume work later without losing progress.

### Git squash

**What it Does**: Combines multiple commits into one, creating a cleaner history.

```bash
git rebase -i <commit-hash>
# Mark commits as "squash" to merge them
```

**Use Case**: Great for cleaning up messy commit histories. For example, if you‚Äôve made several commits fixing minor issues on a single feature, squashing them into one commit can make the history more readable.

### Git cherry-pick

**What it Does**: Applies specific commits from one branch onto another branch.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

**Use Case**: Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a bug fix on another branch you want to apply without merging the entire branch. Cherry-picking lets you apply just that specific fix.

### Resolving merge conflicts

Conflicts happen when Git can‚Äôt automatically merge changes from different branches. Don‚Äôt panic! They‚Äôre common and solvable.

**Steps to Resolve Conflicts**:

1. Git will mark files with conflicts.
    
2. Open these files and look for conflict markers:
    
    ```bash
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    # Code from the current branch
    =======
    # Code from the branch being merged
    >>>>>>> feature-branch
    ```
    
3. Decide which code to keep or combine both sections.
    
4. Remove conflict markers, save changes, and commit.
    

```bash
# Check for conflicts
git status

# After resolving, add files and commit
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

Generally, conflict arises when two people edit the same file on the same line and git gets confused about which particular changes to add and which to not.

**Use Case**: Essential for collaboration. You‚Äôll run into conflicts whenever multiple team members work on the same files, especially on larger projects.

### Putting It All Together

These commands will significantly enhance your Git and GitHub workflow, whether working alone or collaborating on a team. Knowing how to reset commits, resolve conflicts, and manage branches can keep your project history organized and maintainable.

And remember, while these commands are powerful, some of them (like `reset --hard`) can be destructive. Use them carefully, and don‚Äôt hesitate to practice in a safe environment before applying them to critical projects.
