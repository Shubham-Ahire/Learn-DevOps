In today's cloud-driven world, designing a robust Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is crucial for hosting applications in a production environment. This article walks you through creating a VPC that employs Auto Scaling, Application Load Balancers, and secure subnets to ensure high availability and security for your servers.

### Overview of the Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a VPC configured for servers in a production setting. The architecture emphasizes resiliency by deploying servers across two Availability Zones (AZs) using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The servers are placed in private subnets for added security, while a NAT gateway allows them to access the internet when needed.

### Key Components

* **VPC**: The foundation of your network, providing isolated resources.
    
* **Subnets**: Public and private subnets to separate traffic and enhance security.
    
* **Auto Scaling Group**: Automatically adjusts the number of running servers based on demand.
    
* **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets.
    
* **NAT Gateway**: Allows outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.
    

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a VPC

1. **Log in to your AWS Management Console**.
    
2. **Navigate to the VPC Dashboard**.
    
3. **Click on "Create VPC"**:
    
    * Name your VPC (e.g., Project-vpc).
        
    * Choose an IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
        
    * Select ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù for the Tenancy option.
        
    * Click "Create".
        

### Step 2: Create Subnets

#### Public Subnets

1. **In the VPC Dashboard**, click on "Subnets" and then "Create Subnet".
    
2. **Enter details for the first public subnet**:
    
    * Name: `PublicSubnetA`
        
    * VPC: Select your VPC.
        
    * Availability Zone: Select the first AZ (e.g., `us-east-1a`).
        
    * CIDR Block: `10.0.1.0/24`.
        
3. **Create another public subnet** for the second AZ:
    
    * Name: `PublicSubnetB`
        
    * Availability Zone: Select the second AZ (e.g., `us-east-1b`).
        
    * CIDR Block: `10.0.2.0/24`.
        
4. **Repeat this process** for private subnets:
    
    * Private Subnet A: `10.0.3.0/24` in `us-east-1a`.
        
    * Private Subnet B: `10.0.4.0/24` in `us-east-1b`.
        

### Step 3: Configure the Internet Gateway

1. **In the VPC Dashboard**, click on "Internet Gateways" and then "Create Internet Gateway".
    
2. **Name your gateway** (e.g., `MyInternetGateway`) and attach it to your VPC.
    

### Step 4: Set Up NAT Gateway

1. **Create an Elastic IP** in the EC2 Dashboard to allocate for the NAT Gateway.
    
2. **In the VPC Dashboard**, go to "NAT Gateways" and click "Create NAT Gateway".
    
3. **Select a public subnet** (e.g., `PublicSubnetA`) and associate the Elastic IP you created.
    
4. **Click "Create NAT Gateway"**.
    

### Step 5: Configure Route Tables

1. **Public Route Table**:
    
    * Go to "Route Tables" in the VPC Dashboard.
        
    * Create a new route table, associate it with the public subnets, and add a route:
        
        * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
            
        * Target: Your Internet Gateway.
            
2. **Private Route Table**:
    
    * Create another route table for the private subnets and add a route:
        
        * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
            
        * Target: Your NAT Gateway.
            
    * Associate this route table with both private subnets.
        

### Step 6: Launch EC2 Instances

1. **Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard** and select "Launch Instance".
    
2. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** that suits your application needs.
    
3. **Select Instance Type** and configure details:
    
    * Set Network to your VPC.
        
    * Choose the private subnets for the instances.
        
    * **Enable Auto-assign Public IP**: Ensure this is disabled for instances in private subnets.
        
4. **Add Storage** and tags as necessary.
    
5. **Configure Security Groups** to allow traffic from the ALB.
    

### Step 7: Set Up Application Load Balancer

1. **In the EC2 Dashboard**, select "Load Balancers" and click "Create Load Balancer".
    
2. **Choose Application Load Balancer** and configure:
    
    * Name: `MyAppLoadBalancer`.
        
    * Scheme: Internet-facing.
        
    * Select the public subnets for the load balancer.
        
3. **Configure Listeners** (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) and target groups:
    
    * Point the target group to your EC2 instances in the private subnet.
        
4. **Review and create the load balancer**.
    

### Step 8: Configure Auto Scaling Group

1. **In the EC2 Dashboard**, click on "Auto Scaling Groups" and select "Create Auto Scaling group".
    
2. **Choose Launch Template** or create a new one with the instance details.
    
3. **Configure settings**:
    
    * Set the minimum, maximum, and desired capacity based on your requirements.
        
    * Attach the Auto Scaling group to your load balancer.
        
4. **Review and create the Auto Scaling group**.

**Here we have demonstrated to create a VPC that you can use for servers in Production Environment.**

### Conclusion:

We 've successfully created a resilient VPC architecture suitable for a production environment. This setup not only enhances the availability of your application through Auto Scaling and Load Balancers but also ensures that your servers are secure within private subnets. By leveraging the NAT Gateway, your instances can access the internet while remaining protected from direct exposure.

This architecture forms a robust foundation for deploying applications in the cloud, providing both scalability and security. Keep exploring further optimizations and configurations to suit your specific application needs!
